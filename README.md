3. Find the module on the list of the ones you have installed
4. Activate it

## Importing
1. Go to compedium and find the EG compedium that were created/installed
2. Right click on the macro and select "import all content"
3. Do the same for the rolltables
4. Optional - repeat for the journals

## How to use
1. Use the macro to outpput/whisper the generated result to chat
2. Click on the link in the first journal to act as a button. 


## Optional
Click on the link/button in the accompanying journal to act the same as the macro, saving space on your hotbar. 

IMPORTANT. The macro MUST be imported first for this journal option to work.

If you have more than one module from EG installed and active, these Journals can be combined by copy pasting the links from one to another to save space and have things in one location.

The scound journal, named along the lines of "(x) Output" (where x is related to the name of the module) will save the last result rolled in chat and be overwritten when the macro is run again. 


## Other Module Recomendations/Suggestions

The modules listed below will make things easier, more organised and genrally improve your expereince, but are not needed to run this module.

- GM Screen (Highly recommened) 
Put/drag the journal with the macro onto the gm screen and have it ready to be used from there, create tabs for various collections and so on. The output journal can also be dragged-dropped onto here (into a different cell) as well, so that both the control and the output can be seen and accessed on the screen at the same time.

- Compendium Folders - keep tables organised/grouped together
- Macro Folders - Macro organisation
- Monks Enhanced Journal - Another way of displaying your journals and their contents
